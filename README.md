# The Learn Philosophy

# Welcome!!!!

Welcome to Learn! We're thrilled that you've joined our community of learners!

## The Learn Community

Learn is designed for people who are passionate, curious, self-driven, and absolutely serious about learning to code. We are on a never ending quest for knowledge and we know there are no shortcuts.

Most people on Learn have already been learning to code a bit by using the amazing and plentiful resources all around the internet. However, in developing the content on Learn, we made no assumptions. It is designed for absolute beginners. If for any reason you find it overwhelming at first, ask for help and an instructor from the community will be glad to help.

Learn will demand that you be patient, resilient, resourceful, and gritty. Isn't that the kind of person you want to be? We think that's the kind of person you already are.

We do our best to offer a curriculum that is clear, digestible, engaging, challenging, and deep. The curriculum you'll encounter on Learn is rigorous. Expect it to be a little more challenging than other online learning platforms. We don't dumb anything down because we believe in your infinite capacity to learn.

Finally, we don't believe in learning alone. As you make progress, expect to bump into other learners just like you, ready and willing to help each other succeed. Together, we can go further than we could ever go alone. We expect everyone on Learn to be friendly, respectful, helpful, and nice. Learn is something special.
