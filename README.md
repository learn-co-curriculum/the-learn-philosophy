# Welcome to Learn

Welcome to Learn! We're thrilled that you've joined our community of learners!
In this lesson, we want to talk about the Learn platform and philosophy.

The Learn platform, this web application with text to read, labs to move to
"success," etc., is designed for people who are passionate, curious,
self-driven, and serious about learning.

We are comrades in a never-ending quest for knowledge. While there are no
shortcuts, we believe that by providing knowledge in an optimized order,
reinforcing knowledge with automated feedback from hands-on labs, and providing
opportunities for discussion and feedback you will learn quickly. Learn is
Flatiron School's framework for delivering that experience to you.  Our goal is
provide you with the right materials, support and structure _you_ need to
discover your own love for the material.

## Building Birdhouses

Imagine that we want to learn how to build a birdhouse but do not have any
experience with carpentry. Where would we start? Is it necessary to _first_
learn everything about the particular type of wood we are using? Or how nails
and hammers are made?

No. It may be _valuable_ to know what type of wood we're using, or _interesting_
to understand how nails are made, but these things won't stop us from
successfully building a birdhouse. In fact, we likely won't fully appreciate the
materials, the wood and nails we're using until we've gone through the
experience of _building the birdhouse first_.

We call this approach "starting in the middle." We neither work bottom-up
(explaining wood and nail manufacture as a first step) nor top-down (here's a
bird house, take it apart and distill each concept until you reach an atomic
idea). Instead we work from the middle: provide a relatable context, try it,
try it again, break it down (a bit) and then explain how it integrates to the
next idea. Let's imagine how this relates to birdhouses.

After building birdhouse "Version 1," we can go back and better understand the
best type of wood to use for our purposes, or realize that glue works just as
well as nails and is much easier to use.  When we build birdhouse "Version 2,"
we'll repeat the original again, but it'll be way better. By birdhouse "Version
3," we'll know how everything fits together just by _looking_ at the materials.
By "Version 15" we'll have developed a custom birdhouse building tool that,
based on an input latitude / longitude submitted via smart phone, chooses the
optimal wood for the bug populations and climates, cuts the wood, glues the
edges, assembles and ships the birdhouse within 30 seconds of order.

In this scenario, we will have become birdhouse magnates all without
understanding one whit about nail manufacture, wood harvesting, or ornithology.

## Writing Code

Learning how to program is not much different.  Where do we start? How do we
know what is necessary to understand _first?_ Again, we _start in the middle_.

Learn handles the guiding from the middle, _for you_. It provides an
environment that gets past some of the initial hurdles, making sure you are off
the ground faster, learning what is necessary for your success. As you
progress, you will be gaining the skills you need to pursue programming in
whichever direction you choose.

Most people on Learn have already been learning to code a bit by using the
amazing and plentiful resources all around the internet. In developing the
content here on Learn, though, we make no assumptions. It is designed for
absolute beginners. Lessons build off each other, providing the tools and
concepts necessary to complete future lessons.

What we don't do, however, is dumb anything down. We believe in your infinite
capacity to learn. We do our best to offer a curriculum that is clear,
digestible, engaging, challenging, and deep. The curriculum you'll encounter on
Learn is rigorous and will demand that you be patient, resilient, resourceful,
and gritty.

From the beginning, we'll make sure you have the support and tools you need;
you just need to bring the grit.

## The Learn Community

We don't believe in learning alone. As you make progress, expect to bump into
other learners just like you, ready and willing to help each other succeed.
Together, we can go further than we could ever go alone. We expect everyone on
Learn to be friendly, respectful, helpful, and nice. Learn is something special.

If for any reason you find it overwhelming at first, or if you get really stuck
along the way, ask for help and an instructor from the community will be glad to
help. There is an 'Ask a Question' button in all lessons on
[Learn.co](https://learn.co) for this reason. You can also see questions from
other students who may be working on similar problems.

## The In-Browser Learn IDE

One of the time-consuming parts of getting started with programming is setting
up your work environment. Many a developer has found their motivation to learn
something undone by a programming environment that was so complex to set up
that they wrongly assumed that "If I can't set up the language, there's no way
I can _use the language_." Nothing can be further from the truth! Often times
building the coding environment is many times harder than using it!
Unfortunately, for may code learners, they get stymied getting the right
versions of the language you're learning, finding a good text editor, moving
and copying files, interpreting Byzantine error messages, downloading
"developer kit extras" for the OS etc. _instead_ of learning programming!

Learn provides a solution for this so you can get to writing code faster: the
in-browser Learn IDE.  The in-browser IDE is a fully-functional text editor and
command line interface, connected with your GitHub account through Learn. It
automates some steps for us and also comes with some built in command line tools
such as `learn`, used for running tests in later lessons. If "command line" and
"editor" are still new concepts to you, don't worry, you'll be getting to know
them in upcoming work.

Eventually, when you dive deeper and create your own projects, you'll likely
decide to set up your own work environment; or, you may already have some
experience coding and are an [Atom](https://atom.io/) whiz. If you'd like to
use your own local environment instead, visit the [Learning
Environment](https://learn.co/account/environment) section in the Manage
Account of Learn.  Make sure to choose which setting you'd like before
continuing.

If you have opted for the in-browser IDE, you'll notice a 'Sandbox' button on
the top right of this lesson readme. This will also extend to all other READMEs
as well. The Sandbox acts as a scratch pad for practicing as you read lessons,
and will save any files you create or edit for later reference.  On lessons
where there are tests, the 'Sandbox' button becomes an 'Open IDE' button,
which, when clicked, will create your own copy of the lesson files to work on.

Additional resources for setting up are linked at the bottom of this lesson. And
remember, if you're not sure of something, feel free to use the 'Ask a Question'
button!

## Conclusion

You're just getting started, and we're happy you're here. To proceed to the next
lesson, press the "I'm Done" button in the right rail then click "Next Lesson".

Happy Learning!
